**THE SIGNAL**  
A short sci‑fi drama  


---


**FADE IN:**  


**EXT. DESERTED HIGHWAY – NIGHT**  
A full moon hangs low over an empty two‑lane road stretching into black hills. A solitary RADIO TENT (canvas, weathered) glows under floodlights at the edge of the asphalt.  


**ANGLE ON** the tent’s entrance flap, gently flapping in a chill breeze.  


**INT. RADIO TENT – CONTINUOUS**  
Rows of vintage radio gear hum. Cables snake across the floor. ELA (28, determined, in rugged field‑gear) sits behind a console of dials and meters, headphones on. A single lantern casts sharp shadows.  


> **SOUND:** Radio static crackles.  


ELA  
*(into mic)*  
Command, do you copy? Over.  


She twists a knob. The static intensifies, then briefly clears.  


MARCUS (V.O.)  
*(faint, urgent)*  
…help…engine failure…coordinates… Desolation Road…  


Ela’s eyes snap open. She scribbles the coordinates on a notepad.  


ELA  
*(softly)*  
Got it. Stay calm. I’ll send help.  


She flips a switch. A tone bleeps.  


**CUT TO:**  


**EXT. CRASH SITE – FLASHBACK**  


**EXT. ROCKY OUTCROP – EARLIER THAT NIGHT**  
A battered PERSONAL SPACECRAFT lies half‑buried in sand and rock. Sparks flicker from the torn hull. Inside, MARCUS (35, veteran pilot, weary) struggles to clear debris.  


MARCUS  
*(groans)*  
Computer, status report.  


**INT. COCKPIT – CONTINUOUS**  
Red warning lights blink on the console.  


AI VOICE (O.S.)  
Life support at twenty‑three percent. Engine integrity critical. Radio beacon offline.  


MARCUS  
*(breathless)*  
Then manually reboot comms. Now.  


He rips out a panel, exposes wires. Sparks fly. He clamps two leads together.  


**EXTREME CLOSE‑UP** on his hand bridging the circuit.  


**SFX:** A surge of electricity.  


**INT. COCKPIT – CONTINUOUS**  
The panels flicker back to life.  


AI VOICE (O.S.)  
Reestablishing signal.  


**CUT BACK TO:**  


**INT. RADIO TENT – NIGHT**  
Ela leans forward, listening.  


MARCUS (V.O.)  
Coordinates are 36.114, –115.172. Hurry. Over.  


Ela punches the numbers into her GPS device.  


ELA  
Sheriff Miller! You awake?  


She lifts a handheld radio.  


**INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE (WHEREVER) – NIGHT**  
SHERIFF MILLER (50s, grizzled but caring) jolts upright in bed, the radio’s buzzer piercing the calm.  


SHERIFF MILLER  
*(into radio)*  
Ela? What is it now?  


ELA (V.O.)  
We’ve got a downed pilot, 10 klicks east. Bad shape. Need search party now.  


SHERIFF MILLER  
Copy that. I’m on my way.  


He grabs his jacket and keys.  


**DISSOLVE TO:**  


**EXT. DESOLATION ROAD – LATE NIGHT**  
Headlights carve two beams through darkness. A sheriff’s SUV rattles along a dirt spur.  


**INT. SHERIFF’S SUV – MOVING**  
Sheriff Miller consults a map on his dashboard.  


SHERIFF MILLER  
*(muttering to himself)*  
36.114, –115.172… gotta be close.  


He stops, grabs a spotlight, and hops out.  


**EXT. CRASH SITE – MOMENTS LATER**  
The SUV’s spotlight swings across the wreck. Sheriff Miller rushes to the cockpit.  


MARCUS  
*(weak, coughing)*  
You… you made it.  


Sheriff Miller peers in as Marcus tries to sit up.  


SHERIFF MILLER  
Stay still. Medics are en route.  


Marcus’s breathing is ragged. He spots Ela running in with a first‑aid kit.  


MARCUS  
Thank you… Ela.  


ELA  
We’ll get you out of here.  


**She kneels beside him, applying a bandage.**  


**ANGLE ON** the spacecraft’s hull where a small PANEL flickers – a final piece of AI hardware glows.  


**CUT TO:**  


**INT. RADIO TENT – DAWN**  
Sunrise bleeds through the tent flap. Ela sits alone, headphones off, staring at the empty seat beside her. The radio console is silent.  


She picks up a PHOTO pinned to the board: Marcus standing proudly next to his ship before the flight.  


Sheriff Miller’s footsteps approach. He slips inside and sets down a steaming mug of coffee.  


SHERIFF MILLER  
He made it through the night.  


Ela offers a small, relieved smile.  


ELA  
Thanks to you all.  


They share a quiet moment.  


**OVER THE RADIO**: a single soft BLEEP. Ela hesitates, then lifts the receiver.  


**AI VOICE (calm, hopeful)**  
Power levels nominal. Ready for extraction?  


Ela’s eyes light up.  A


ELA  
*(into mic, excited)*  
Affirmative. Let’s bring him home.  


**FADE OUT.**
